# Weather

I think weather is _awesome_ and so when I want to play with something new I make a new version of this weather forecast app in those new things.

## Current

React (feat. TypeScript) front end, and a very simple, probably not idiomatic, Elixir API server.

## 2017

An Express.js app with Handlebars templating, and some plain old JS.

## 2016

The OG version. Built with good old HTML and jQuery.
